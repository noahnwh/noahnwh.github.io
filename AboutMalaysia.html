                    <p>Malaysia's history is a colorful tapestry of influences. The earliest records of the region date back to ancient times, with evidence of human habitation dating back 40,000 years. Influenced by Indian and Chinese traders who brought Hinduism and Buddhism to the region in the first millennium B.C., the region became part of a thriving trade network.</p>

                    <p>In the 15th century, the Malacca Sultanate became a prominent maritime and commercial power, controlling the Strait of Malacca, an important trade route. The spread of Islam in the region during this period marked a major shift in the cultural and religious landscape of Malaysia.</p>
                        
                    <p>The arrival of the Portuguese in 1511, followed by the Dutch and the British in the 18th and 19th centuries, brought colonial influence to Malaysia. The British took control of the Malay Peninsula and formed the Federation of Malaya in 1895 and later in 1948. During the Second World War, Japan occupied Malaya but the British regained control after the war.</p>
                        
                    <p>On August 31, 1957, Malaysia gained independence from Britain and was initially known as the Federation of Malaya. 1963 saw the expansion of Malaya into Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak to form Malaysia. Later, Singapore became independent in 1965.</p>
